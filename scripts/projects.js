      objective: "To investigate if alternative forms of work, such as third spaces, could benefit delivery of psychotherapy and counselling in Ontario.",
      summary: "Using design research methods, clients & therapists were interviewed to reveal core problem areas within Ontario’s mental health care system. With these perspectives in mind, a product was generated to make real the possibility of a new system for the practice of therapy.",

Under “contexts” are private residences, office buildings, and online. Under “sectors” are public and private. Under “trends” are collaborative care hubs, online & telehealth therapy, and a growing workforce.",
      panel1title: "Learning About Mental Health Care in Ontario",
      panel1text: "Statistics show that there is a high demand for therapy services, with almost half of those with therapy/counselling needs not being able to access care in 2022. Emerging trends in the field of mental health care, such as collaborative care models & virtual/online services have shown potential to improve access but professional shortages and long waitlists still restrict access to the proper standard of care.",

      panel2title: "Understanding Client & Therapist Perspectives",
      panel2text: "User interviews allowed me to understand typical client journeys and the daily work routines of therapists. From this I learned that despite an eagerness to provide more interconnected care, new therapists in private practice don’t consider working in more collaborative environments, such as coworking spaces, because of the lack of resources available to create an atmosphere that meets both their own needs and their clients’ needs.",

The second image (center) is a photograph from a side angle of a person sitting in a chair beneath a full-scale model of the previous concept. The third image (right) is a comic/narrative prototype showing a therapist bringing the device to a coworking space, setting it up, and taking it apart.",
      panel3title: "How Might We Create the Therapeutic Environment Anywhere?",
      panel3text: "To give therapists the opportunity to expand their working environments, I explored different ways the therapeutic atmosphere could be recreated. I focused on creating a perceived division between therapy and the outside world and tested these ideas through scale models and narrative prototypes for participant feedback.",

      panel4text: "The final concept was a portable therapy environment that could be assembled in any environment with a private room. Final details such as the refined form, CMF, and manufacturing methods were explored. Mock-ups and renders were created with tools such as Adobe Illustrator, SolidWorks, and Keyshot.",

A posterboard and a short video were created to present the final solution to the public. This was an ambitious project but one I found immense value in. The final product explored one approach to improving Ontario’s mental health care, but there is still much potential in tackling the multitude of interconnected problems.<br><br>You can view the project on the School of Industrial Design's website: <a href='https://carleton.ca/id/story/camryn-odonnell/'>https://carleton.ca/id/story/camryn-odonnell/</a>",

She works part-time at the Rideau Centre and has a busy schedule between school and work. She doesn’t have a licence and wants to save money so she relies heavily on the bus. Apps Used: Google Maps,Transit. Goals: plan her bus routes before her trips, be on schedule for work and school, secure personal space on the bus, be COVID-safe on the bus, save money by making use of her UPass. Pain Points: stressed about buses being potentially late, GPS tracking disconnecting, delayed buses making her late, crowded buses and safety measures not being practiced, concerned about the cleanliness of bus seats, handles, and buzzers. Quote: “I always leave early because I can’t fully trust the bus schedule or GPS tracking.”.",

The background of the bus route icon was removed to make it look less like a button and the reset button was changed from a trash icon to a counter-clockwise arrow icon. Second improvement: lack of feedback. Added a screen to confirm set up. Third improvement: insufficient level of detail. Added flashing animation to “Favourites” section to show changes on update. Added text under the menu icons.",
      panel3title: "Clickable Prototype & User Testing",
      panel3text: "Key features of the app, such as <strong>setting up a commute and <strong>live bus tracking, were identified and structured using an information architecture. From there, we created wireframes of potential screens, and then clickable prototypes of three core user flows using Figma. User testing was conducted with participants to further refine the ease of use.",

      objective: "To investigate “ghost buildings” within Ottawa and produce a counter-cartography communicating the research findings.",
      summary: "Partnering with two designers and an anthropologist, desk research and observational fieldwork were conducted into the financialization of housing. This knowledge was used to craft a workshop, which was held with members of the public, to discover the relationship between people’s homes, their neighbourhoods, and their communities. A map was created using the findings and insights gained from the workshop, and an interactive report was written to document our research.",

There are construction pylons in front of the house to the left.",
      panel1title: "What are “Ghost Buildings”?",
      panel1text: "As housing has become more commodified, some have hypothesized a phenomenon called “ghost buildings”—housing owned only as a financial asset without actual tenants. To investigate the validity and presence of these “ghost buildings”, we reviewed previous research on the subject and observed different neighbourhoods across Ottawa. At the end of our fieldwork, we concluded that perhaps the term “ghost buildings” could be extended to “ghost” neighbourhoods or communities.",

The second thread Starts with Create an Ideal Community, then evolves into City Diorama. City Diorama has a callout showing a sketch of people standing around a diorama of a neighbourhood. The next ideas in the thread are Fill-in the Blank and Fill in a map. Fill in a Map has a callout showing a sketch of a map of a neighbourhood with a blank space in it. The next ideas in the thread are Work/icon bank, Drawing your Community, Workbooks, and question cards. The third thread is Group Discussion. The next ideas in the thread are Sharing Stories, Drawing Your Community, and Collective Mind Map. The fourth thread has one idea in it called Lights and Buildings. The fifth thread begins with Community Character. The next ideas in the thread are Build-a-Ghost and Community Personality Rest. The third, fourth, and fifth threads merge together at the idea called Ghost Building Collage. Ghost Building Collage has a callout showing a sketch of two boards with house-shaped cards attached to them, the first titled non-ghost and the second titled ghost.",
      panel2title: "Developing a Research Activity",
      panel2text: "Armed with a foundational understanding of the context, we began developing a design workshop as a research tool to capture others’ perceptions of “ghost communities”. We wanted to investigate how “ghost buildings” are created and how they impact their surroundings. We brainstormed activities that would encourage people to share their stories and feelings about their homes and neighbourhoods.",

The third photo (right) shows a foam-core board labelled non-ghost with construction paper houses attached to it. The houses have writing on them.",
      panel3title: "Conducting a Design Workshop",
      panel3text: "The workshop was conducted with 20 participants. We began by sharing our initial research and understanding of “ghost buildings”. We then asked participants help create a collage of “ghost” and “non-ghost” buildings using their understanding of the concepts. After the activity, question cards were provided for participants to answer in their own time.",

      panel4title: "Synthesizing the Findings",
      panel4text: "Collecting the findings from the workshop, we found recurring themes for “ghost” and “non-ghost” communities. The idea of “ghost” communities evoked feelings of alienation and loss, with themes such as restricted access to spaces, emptiness, lack of utility, and nostalgia. On the other hand, “non-ghost” communities were defined by a sense of activity and interaction and associated with vibrant sensory experiences.",
