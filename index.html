                    <h1 class="heading1">Hi!<br>My Name is Camryn O'Donnell</h1>
                    <p class="heading2">I am a <span role="text" class="red">multidisciplinary designer</span> with an
                        interest in <span role="text" class="green">UX/UI design</span> & <span role="text"
                            class="blue">design research.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm passionate about design and I'm always looking for new ways in which design can be used as a
                        tool to bridge gaps and help others! Design research is one of my areas of expertise and I am
                        eager to explore a wide range of fields and design methodologies including co-design,
                        participatory design, and speculative design.
                        <br><br>
                        What interests me most about design is learning how people interact with the objects and systems
                        surrounding them and I think this context is key to uncovering the root of any problem. Through
                        continuous collaboration and learning I hope to make a positive impact on the world around me.
                        <br><br>
                        When I’m not working, I love being creative, whether that’s drawing, sewing, making music, or
                        cooking. I also enjoy playing video games & tabletop RPGs with friends!

She doesn’t have a licence and wants to save money so she relies heavily on the bus. Apps Used: Google Maps,Transit. Goals: plan her bus routes before her trips, be on schedule for work and school, secure personal space on the bus, be COVID-safe on the bus, save money by making use of her UPass. Pain Points: stressed about buses being potentially late, GPS tracking disconnecting, delayed buses making her late, crowded buses and safety measures not being practiced, concerned about the cleanliness of bus seats, handles, and buzzers. Quote: “I always leave early because I can’t fully trust the bus schedule or GPS tracking.”.">
