      heroalt: "A client and a therapist sitting in a room facing one another. They are surrounded by foldable therapy tiles, which are stacked using interlocking slots to create a space divider around them.",

      objective: "To investigate if alternative forms of work, such as third spaces, could benefit delivery of psychotherapy and counselling in Ontario.",
      summary: "Using design research methods, clients & therapists were interviewed to reveal core problem areas within Ontario’s mental health care system. With these perspectives in mind, a product was generated to make real the possibility of a new system for the practice of therapy.",

      panel1img: "/assets/Capstone Assets/Capstone Images.png",
      panel1alt: "A mind map of the key stakeholders, sectors, contexts, and trends. Under “stakeholders” are clients and therapists. Under “contexts” are private residences, office buildings, and online. Under “sectors” are public and private. Under “trends” are collaborative care hubs, online & telehealth therapy, and a growing workforce.",
      panel1title: "Learning About Mental Health Care in Ontario",
      panel1text: "Statistics show that there is a high demand for therapy services, with almost half of those with therapy/counselling needs not being able to access care in 2022. Emerging trends in the field of mental health care, such as collaborative care models & virtual/online services have shown potential to improve access but professional shortages and long waitlists still restrict access to the proper standard of care.",

Under “contexts” are private residences, office buildings, and online. Under “sectors” are public and private. Under “trends” are collaborative care hubs, online & telehealth therapy, and a growing workforce.",
      panel2title: "Understanding Client & Therapist Perspectives",
      panel2text: "User interviews allowed me to understand typical client journeys and the daily work routines of therapists. From this I learned that despite an eagerness to provide more interconnected care, new therapists in private practice don’t consider working in more collaborative environments, such as coworking spaces, because of the lack of resources available to create an atmosphere that meets both their own needs and their clients’ needs.",

      panel3alt: "A collage of three images. The first image (left) is a sketch of a concept with two tent-like structures that lean against each other to form an arch over the client and therapist. The second image (center) is a photograph from a side angle of a person sitting in a chair beneath a full-scale model of the previous concept. The third image (right) is a comic/narrative prototype showing a therapist bringing the device to a coworking space, setting it up, and taking it apart.",
      panel3title: "How Might We Create the Therapeutic Environment Anywhere?",
      panel3text: "To give therapists the opportunity to expand their working environments, I explored different ways the therapeutic atmosphere could be recreated. I focused on creating a perceived division between therapy and the outside world and tested these ideas through scale models and narrative prototypes for participant feedback.",

      panel4img: "/assets/Capstone Assets/Capstone Images4.png",
      panel4alt: "A collage of images showing cardboard prototypes, a moodboard, and a 3D rendering of the final concept: foldable tiles that can be assembled by stacking them on top of one another in different configurations.",
      panel4title: "Refining the Portable Therapy Environment",
      panel4text: "The final concept was a portable therapy environment that could be assembled in any environment with a private room. Final details such as the refined form, CMF, and manufacturing methods were explored. Mock-ups and renders were created with tools such as Adobe Illustrator, SolidWorks, and Keyshot.",

      panel5title: "Final Exhibition",
      panel5text: "The final project was exhibited at the grad show held by Carleton’s School of Industrial Design. A posterboard and a short video were created to present the final solution to the public. This was an ambitious project but one I found immense value in. The final product explored one approach to improving Ontario’s mental health care, but there is still much potential in tackling the multitude of interconnected problems.",

      objective: "To create a mobile app that improves the Ottawa Public Transit experience.",
      summary: "With the help of team members, design research was conducted into the user experience of Ottawa transit riders. Participants’ experiences motivated the development of a transit app prototype, which was mocked up in Figma.",

      panel1text: "As a team, we created a research plan to recruit and interview participants on their experiences with Ottawa’s transit system. We were able to create a journey map based on a typical commute, identifying key touchpoints, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.",

She works part-time at the Rideau Centre and has a busy schedule between school and work. She doesn’t have a licence and wants to save money so she relies heavily on the bus. Apps Used: Google Maps,Transit. Goals: plan her bus routes before her trips, be on schedule for work and school, secure personal space on the bus, be COVID-safe on the bus, save money by making use of her UPass. Pain Points: stressed about buses being potentially late, GPS tracking disconnecting, delayed buses making her late, crowded buses and safety measures not being practiced, concerned about the cleanliness of bus seats, handles, and buzzers. Quote: “I always leave early because I can’t fully trust the bus schedule or GPS tracking.”.",
      panel2title: "Identifying Personas",
      panel2text: "Based on the data collected in the research, a persona was created to represent the target user group of the design solution. This persona, Suzie, is a busy student who tries to balance school with a part-time job and wants her daily commute to go as smoothly as possible.",

      panel3img: "/assets/Early/EARLY-Image_3.png",
      panel3alt: "A series screens before and after user testing. First improvement: confusing visual semantics. The background of the bus route icon was removed to make it look less like a button and the reset button was changed from a trash icon to a counter-clockwise arrow icon. Second improvement: lack of feedback. Added a screen to confirm set up. Third improvement: insufficient level of detail. Added flashing animation to “Favourites” section to show changes on update. Added text under the menu icons.",
      panel3title: "Clickable Prototype & User Testing",
      panel3text: "Key features of the app, such as setting up a commute and live bus tracking, were identified and structured using an information architecture. From there, we created wireframes of potential screens, and then clickable prototypes of three core user flows using Figma. User testing was conducted with participants to further refine the ease of use.",

      panel4alt: "A moodboard with images, app UIs, and graphic design inspiration.",
      panel4title: "Final Visual Design",
      panel4text: "With the feedback from user testing, we made tweaks to the user flows to improve the intuitiveness of the app. We also further developed the graphic design to convey a bright, calm, and trustworthy tone.",

Favourite Routes: through a simple set-up process, users can input information about their daily commute to get notifications and updates on the status of most-used bus routes”. Text for the search details: “Planning Tools: Route information is structured to allow new users to learn about Ottawa’s transit system while giving experienced users the most relevant information. Bus Station Info: Bus stations have additional information to help users navigate their transfers.” Text for the view of the current trip” Trip Tracking: Using a combination of official OC Transpo data, traffic data, and crowdsourced information on delays and crowdedness, EARLY provides users with the most relevant & accurate information possible.

By allowing users to input the routes they take regularly, EARLY provides proactive and relevant information to ensure that you are prepared for any roadblocks you may encounter before and during your trip. With route navigation, GPS tracking, and commute information all integrated into one app, EARLY can be the complete solution to navigating Ottawa’s public transit.",
